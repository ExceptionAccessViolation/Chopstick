# Chopstick
A fun little program I wrote in Java as a coding exercise.\
It's currently only player vs player, but I plan to add an AI opponent in the future.

## How to install
Download the latest release's .jar file from [the releases page](https://github.com/ExceptionAccessViolation/Chopstick/releases).

## How to run
1. Make sure you have Java installed. The .jar will only run on versions above and including Java 17.
2. Go to the path of the downloaded jar in a terminal (cmd, powershell, bash, etc.) and run the following command: **java -jar Chopstick.jar**
3. It should now be running in the terminal.

## Todo
1. Fix the Wikipedia page link for the rules (currently redirects to the chopsticks used in eating).
2. Make it more user-intuitive by adding more help messages or GUI implementation in the future.
3. Add an AI opponent.
